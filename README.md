Reinforcement learning on the mountain car problem on 2 strategies 

## First Strategy : Random Steps
The first strategy I will follow is the random steps , which will be just taking steps randomly and
seeing if the car will be able to reach the goal .Ill make the car play 4000 game cycles .

## Second Strategy : Q learning Strategy
To adopt a reinforcement learning for the car in order for it to reach the
flag and that by teaching it according to the reward system .

Q learning and reinforcement learning sure does prove how efficient it is and it has proven that
even with 4000 cycles in the random strategy it was not able to reach even one time capturing
the flag or climb the mountain but with Q learning we were able to reach the flag and climb the
mountain around 4782 times and that because our car is learning .Now of course we can adjust
the learning rate / epsilon / epsilon decaying value /number of cycles which could affect our
result even further .But for now we can conclude that Q learning was essential for such great
output in our car to learn how to climb the mountain .
